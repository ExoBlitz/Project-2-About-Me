# Summary
Hello there, I am Kevin Torres. I'm a Junior at Brockton High School. I was born in Leominster, Massachusetts at around 10:30 PM on December 17, 2002. I'm 100% Puerto Rican and named after Macaulay Culkin's iconic character from 1990's Home Alone.
I adore computers and have chosen to devote my life to what they can create. My dream as a boy was simply create a videogame but that dream has evolved to be to create media to entertain and inspire young people just like myself in the 3rd grade. I believe a good job in computer engineering will be an excellent safety net to make this dream come true. At the end of it all, I would like to enjoy a nice quiet life with an adoring wife and children.
# Family
My family keeps me moving forward every day. Both of my parents were born in Puerto Rico and my stepdad is from Trinidad. My oldest sister was born in Leominster like myself while my other older sister was born in Puerto Rico. My grandparents are my favorite people in the world and they inspire me to be kind to others. We are also a family of pentecostal Christians. My mother and oldest sister work at the A-Affordable down the street from the school and my older sister works with special needs at a housing facility in Brockton. My stepfather usually watches the house due to a disability from back injury but he keeps it clean and orderly.

# Culture

I adore my Puerto Rican heritage. As you can tell by the pan sabao before, I love our cultural foods. My family also makes exceptional rice and we usually call foods by their Spanish names like calling hot cereal exclusively cremita. Obviously, Spanish is my first language however my sisters and I forgot how to speak it due to growing up here, making our trips to Puerto Rico somewhat challenging. However, we still express our culture no matter what by putting our flag everywhere, like all proud Puerto Ricans do.
